# Ford GoBike Data Exploration
by Nafisah Abdulkadir

This project is divided into two major parts. The first part shows an exploratory data analysis on a dataset Ford GoBike System Data. Python programming and data visualization libraries will be used  to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships.

This document explores a dataset containing the trip data of the ford gobike with 183412 records with 15 features (duration_sec, duration_min, duration_hour start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude ,end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, and bike_share_for_all_trip).

Data cleaning will be perfommed on this dataset

# Summary of Findings

It was observed that Customer had more trip time than subscribers, customers do not use bike share at all and start and end station doesnt have so much significance on trid duration. More subscribers than customers.


# Key Insights for Presentation

The trip duration peaked at 600seconds aand it centered on values less than 2000 seconds. The no of trips started close to 8000 and peaked slightly above 12000 trips but we began to see a steady decline after this time.

Only about 20,000 rides were shared and over 160,000 rides were not shared.

The distribution showed more Subscribers than Customers and Customers never used the bike share
